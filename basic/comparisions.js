// console.log(null>0);     /each one of them is false because null is not greater than 0
// console.log(null<0);     /each one of them is false because null is not less than 0
// console.log(null == 0)     /each one of them is false because null is not equal to 0

// console.log(null>=0); // this is true because comparision operator converts/treats the null as a whole number greater than o

// console.log(undefined > 0); / undefined in any case is 'false'

    // '===' : this is called strict check, checks for the datatypes also in comparisions.
    /*Example: */ console.log("2" === 2);
